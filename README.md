This is the Player Statue Generator by Wocas.

The python packges used:
- selenium (browser used = Chrome)
- requests
- pillow


Here is how it works:
1) Hit F5 in the IDLE 
2) Login to your Minecraft account in the tab that just opened and verify 
3) Hit enter in the python widow (where it says hit enter) 
4) To generate a skin, type the following '`main('Username', 'Name', 'Skin', Extra Settings)`' where:
	- Username = The name of your Minecraft account that you used to login.
	- Name = The name that you want to give your statue (!important to take a different name each time!). It needs to be lowercase.
	- Skin = The path address (file location) of the skin. If you are on Windows, it will probably look like `C:/Users/username/path/to/file.png`
	Extra Settings:
   	- Type `Overlay=False` if you don't want to use the overlay (defaulted to True).
Step 4 you can repeat as much as you want. To use it in game, paste the folder "Player Statues" in the datapack folder of your world.
Use "```/function Name:generate```" --> (Name is the Name you gave it in step 4) to generate the player statue and 
Use "```/function Name:remove```" --> (Name is the Name you gave it in step 4) to remove statue
